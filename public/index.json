[{"content":" Welcome to opt-models! # Conversations about building large-scale optimization models with a focus on speed and modern deployment.\nIntroduction ... Intro to a video series on building mathematical optimization models in the AMPL modeling language, solving these in Gurobi, CPLEX, HiGHS and other linear and nonlinear solvers, deploying models as containerized applications, and more. Discuss on Maven We converse on Maven ... We discuss opt-models topics on the Maven platform, where an AI extracts tags from conversations that help you discover related conversations. I think this is an interesting proposition for the optimization tribe, because we use related but often differently named concepts a good deal.
