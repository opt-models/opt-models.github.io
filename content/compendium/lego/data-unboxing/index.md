{{< youtubeLite id="satH4VT8SSs" label="Unbox the Data! .. Build a LEGO® Opt App: PART 03" >}}

We walk through our LEGO data from Rebrickable.com and - using GraphXR for exploratory data analysis (EDA) - we translate its schema into an Entity Relationship Diagram, yielding our optimization app's main entities! (We also meet Legolas Greenleaf, Frankie Poullain and The Darkness ...)
