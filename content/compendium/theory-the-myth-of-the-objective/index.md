An invitation to consider the application of mathematical optimization in light of the view expressed by Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman in their book 'Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned' (2015). I posit that a richness of possible solutions can in many use cases be more valuable than a closer-to-optimum objective value.
