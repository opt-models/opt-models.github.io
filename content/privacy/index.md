- better understand how users like you access and use the site so we can improve the user experience
- for administrative purposes and to comply with any legal obligations
- (where we believe it necessary) to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or violations of this Policy.

### How We Share Your Information

We also disclose information in the following circumstances:

### Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms

We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our site. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our service providers may do so on our behalf). We use cookies for functional purposes only (i.e. to support the proper working of our site) and do not use cookies for advertising or profiling purposes.

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our site, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our site. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.

**Session Cookies** exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our site.

**Persistent Cookies** remain on your device after you have closed your browser or turned off your device. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.

**Disabling Cookies**: Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the site, but some features may not function properly.

## User Generated Content

We invite you to post content on our site, including your comments, images, video, code and any other information that you would like to be available on our site. Content you post to our site will be available to all visitors to our site, and opt-models.org cannot prevent such information from being used by third parties.

## Third-Party Links

Our site contains links to third-party websites, for example to https://github.com/. Any access to, and use of, such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.

## Security of Your Personal Information

We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your login details, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer and choosing robust passwords that nobody else knows or can easily guess. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

## Access to Your Personal Information

You may modify personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified, or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the site for a period of time.

## Your Additional Privacy Rights under GDPR

Where the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) (“GDPR”) applies, in particular when you are accessing the site from a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have the following rights, subject to applicable limitations:

- The right to access your personal information;
- The right to rectify the personal information we hold about you;
- The right to erase your personal information;
- The right to restrict our use of your personal information;
- The right to object to our use of your personal information;
- The right to receive your personal information in a usable electronic format and transmit it to a third party (also known as the right of data portability); and
- The right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

To exercise any of these rights, please email Martin Laskowski (me) at [caretaker@opt-models.org](mailto:caretaker@opt-models.org) and include “GDPR Privacy Request” in your message. Please understand, however, the rights enumerated above are not absolute in all cases. 

Note that when you submit a GDPR request to us we may request additional information from you to confirm your identity.

We will also make best efforts to voluntarily provide the above rights to individuals outside of the EEA (i.e. the rest of the world). We endeavor to comply with GDPR requests within 45 days of receipt, but if we need additional time to handle the request we will notify you.
