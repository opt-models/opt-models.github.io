Fast, large-scale mathematical optimization models drive our stock markets, route ambulances, fly drones, aim space telescopes and supply electricity: **optimization is important and beautiful**. 

For six years at AMPL I had the tremendous luck to learn from seasoned practitioners in our team and in our customers' teams how to build, improve, repair and deploy optimization models in many commercial contexts.

opt-models.org is an attempt to generalize and share insights on speeding, reformulating, translating and integrating optimization models in modern decision and real-time systems.

# Let's start a community

I release content periodically as time allows. If you might like to share your own expertise here or to help shape this open, non-profit space into a solid resource for practitioners, please get in touch! I would love to hear from you.
