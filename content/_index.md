Introducing the Compendium, its intended audience, its two main focuses - a code-first approach to building optimization models and increasing the speed of optimization computation - me (Martin Laskowski) and my motivations for creating this resource.

{{< timelineItem icon="youtube" header="Let's discuss on Maven" >}}
Let us talk shop on the very new social space, Maven, which is attracting a very classy technical crowd. See you there! Discuss the topics covered here on Maven: a social media platform structured around an "interest graph" rather than a "friend/social graph". Maven feels good to me, like a glimpse of a possible shift in online culture from our current limbic-system hacking reality to something healthier and promoting of genuine serendipity. Take a look.
