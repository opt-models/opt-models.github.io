Intro to a video series on building mathematical optimization models in the AMPL modeling language, solving these in Gurobi, CPLEX, HiGHS and other linear and nonlinear solvers, deploying models as containerized applications, and more.

{{< timelineItem icon="heart-empty" header="We converse on Maven ..." >}}
We discuss opt-models topics on the Maven platform, where an AI extracts tags from conversations that help you discover related conversations. I think this is an interesting proposition for the optimization tribe, because we use related but often differently named concepts a good deal. Join me on Maven, you might like it.
